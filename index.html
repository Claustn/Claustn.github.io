      Recently I had a discussion with a friend of mine with regards to checking AD passwords against the “P0wned password list” released by Troy Hunt.
So I went and downloaded the the file from here
That turned out to be a 8.8 GB Zip file, that unpacked to almost 19GB of raw text. (The file consists of to columns of data the NTHash and the number of occurrences across password leaks.

      I was working with a customer; all their admin users had at least three accounts, a regular account, a domain admin account and a “server admin” account, some even had a “client admin” account as well per domain.
In a discussion with security, they told me that now, everything was good, and they were more secure. I told them that in theory, they were more secure, but what if their admins just used the same password for all their accounts.

      A friend of mine had had to go through a lot of data, and substitute some values… But these weren’t 1-1 replacement, he had to find the value which was in HEX and then convert them to regular characters.
The files he had to traverse had several million lines each, so certain performance considerations had to be taken.
My initial thinking was to use regular expressions, since they excel at manipulating text.

      I have been playing a lot with Azure automation, and Azure DSC pullserver in particular. I will not get into DSC or Azure automation in great detail in this post.
My goal was to set up an Automation Account, that could be used to handle multiple different servers and setups, so that meant that I had to install multiple DSC resources into the Automation account.
Currently there is a limitation in Azure DSC pullserver, that it does not support versioned modules (https://azure.

      <p>Today I was working at a client, doing a bunch of Azure Automation stuff, moving a lot of the scheduled jobs into Azure Automation, when I noticed this little button.</p>
<p>So I had to dig a little deeper, you can now run your Hybrid Worker Jobs as user, that you have stored in your Azure Automation credential store. Before Hybrid Worker jobs, would run as “LocalSystem” since that is the account the agent is running under.</p>

      One of the new features of PowerShell v5 DSC, is that you now can use ConfigurationNames in “clear-text” not GUID, meaning that you can now have human readable names for your configurations. Since they are easier to guess, then there is an added layer of security, now the Pull clients have to register themselves with the Pull server, with a preshared key. When this happens the client LCM will generate a unique AgentID that is used to discern the different clients.

      <p>I was playing around with Microsoft ORK (Operational Readiness Kit), which is a frontend for the PowerShell deployment toolkit, aimed at hosters.
I wanted to try to do a greenfield install, using a clean Server 2012R2 machine, which had not been joined to any domain, and run everything off that machine. I had downloaded all the pre reqs, and started the install, but it kept failing.</p>
<p>It entered an infinite loop, trying to access the PowerShell AD provider, so my first thought is that I will just turn off the autoload of the AD provider, by setting an environment variable</p>
