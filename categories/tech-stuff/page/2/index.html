Today we found a few SIM cards lying around, the only thing on them was the SIM card number (19 digits). When I went to compare that to the info in the file, I realised that that was not noted in the file, so I had no way to match the SIM with a Phone number, PIN/PUK code.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2009-07-30-editing-excel-using-powershell/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2009-07-27-prevent-screensaver/>Prevent-Screensaver</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2009-07-27</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/powershell/>PowerShell</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content>A while back I created a small AutoIt script, to prevent the screensaver from kicking in, last employer had screensaver kick after 5 min, which was rather annoying when you are out doing presentations, and you have to punch in your password everytime the screensaver kicks in..
Then I read a post from Dimitry Sotnikov that he had written a small PowerShell script to do something similar, and figured out that he uses Wshell to send a keystroke, I thought that could be annoying, if you start working on the computer, and forget to stop the execution of the script, and it suddenly types a character.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2009-07-27-prevent-screensaver/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2009-03-11-new-powershell-brushes-for-syntax-highlighter-plus/>New Powershell brushes for Syntax Highlighter plus</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2009-03-11</span></div><div class=post-content>Since I once in a while post powershell scripts on my site, I like that fact that I can have them color highlighted for better readability, so I played around with several different syntax highlighters, but none of them was able to do powershell, so I created a brush for Syntax highligther plus.
This is my initial attempt, updated to work with Syntax Highlighter plus 2

So I took the challenge, and wrote this little script.
This script will lrecurse through the InitialFolder and all of its subfolders for Desktop.Ini files, it will then loop through each of the files, and add the DENY setting on the read permission for the local administrators group.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2009-03-01-set-file-permissions-with-set-acl/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2009-01-20-tomtom-930t-and-bibob/>TomTom 930T and Bibob</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2009-01-20</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/930t/>930T</a>&nbsp;

5 Min is a very short time, when you are doing presentations or showing video content, so I decided to create a little AutoIT script to move the mouse 1 pixel after 4 min and 59 sec.
I decided to create a small tray icon, where I can choose how many minutes I want it to run for, and the icon changes in color, when the “screensaver free” time is running out.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2009-01-20-prevent-screensaver-from-disturbing-my-presentations/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2009-01-15-quick-and-dirty-ping-script/>Quick and dirty ping script</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2009-01-15</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/batch/>batch</a>&nbsp;
