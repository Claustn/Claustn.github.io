So I had to create some users in Active Directory, I thought I would create a PowerShell script to do that (Must keep your PS skill fresh :)
So I wrote a little code snippet to create a few OU’s.

First off I remembered seeing someone creating a PowerShell script, that read the input from WSH’s InputBox() by using the COM object MSScriptControl.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2008-05-06-browseforfolder-vbscriptpowershell/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2008-04-29-learning-powershell/>Learning PowerShell</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2008-04-29</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/posh/>PoSH</a>&nbsp;

One of his suggestions was to read a PowerShell help file every day… Just go through the help files one by one, you will most likely not remember all of it, but if you read enough, some point might stick ;-)</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2008-04-29-learning-powershell/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2008-04-16-test-flash-drive/>Test Flash Drive</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2008-04-16</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/flash/>Flash</a>&nbsp;

In short, modern RAM contrary to popular belief does not instantly loose its contents, it degrades gradually over time.
What does this mean ?
One security issue that could arise from the fact that most disk encryption software keeps the encryption key and pre computed key schedules in memory for performance reasons, meaning that if an attacker gains access to the machine he can copy these for offline attacks.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2008-02-24-dram-data-rentention/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/categories/tech-stuff/page/2/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
