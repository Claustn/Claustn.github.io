First we need to open profiles.ps1 , this file can be put in the WindowsPowershell folder under System32, or in the users \My Documents\WindowsPowerShell.

get-eventlog -logname Application -newest 15 get-eventlog -logname System -newest 15 get-eventlog -logname Application -newest 15
Of course not, PowerShell is much smarter than that&amp;hellip;
You can use the &amp;lsquo;foreach&amp;rsquo; command.
foreach ($eventlog in (get-eventlog -list -asString)) {write-host $eventlog; get-eventlog $eventlog -newest 15}</description></item><item><title>Getting info from the eventlog with PowerShell</title><link>/posts/2007-06-18-getting-info-from-the-eventlog-with-powershell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jun 2007 15:14:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2007-06-18-getting-info-from-the-eventlog-with-powershell/</guid><description>Started playing around with PowerShell, so I thought I would post a few simple things on the blog, maybe you won&amp;rsquo;t find it interesting, but it is a good way for me to remember, so BLAH!.
First in order to get information from the eventlog you call the cmdlet called:
get-eventlog
Then you need to tell it what you want to get.
get-eventlog -logname Application
Which will get you the Application log on the local machine.</description></item><item><title>Very good beginners guide to PowerShell</title><link>/posts/2007-06-13-very-good-beginners-guide-to-powershell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jun 2007 16:59:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2007-06-13-very-good-beginners-guide-to-powershell/</guid><description>I recently stumbled upon this little e-book about PowerShell, I have&amp;rsquo;nt read it from end to end yet, but from what I have read so far, it seems very good&amp;hellip; So if you are interested in starting to learn some PowerShell this is a good place to start.

Moderne servere har enormt mange kræfter, og det sker derfor ofte at det langt overstiger hvad en applikation reelt skal bruge, derfor er det lavet flere undersøgelser, som rent faktisk har vist, at en gennemsnits server idag, kun bruger ca 5% CPU kraft, det vil sige at der er en masse spildte ressourcer.</description></item></channel></rss>
