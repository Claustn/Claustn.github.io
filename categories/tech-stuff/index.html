But people are also very helpful, and quick to jump in if someone has a problem or even if someone just posts a piece of code they find useful, people tend to jump in with suggestions/additions to make the script even better… Here is an example of a script that went from 14 lines of code to 334 in half a day.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2011-01-06-the-revolution-of-a-script/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2010-05-30-output-a-sortable-html-table/>Output a sortable HTML table</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2010-05-30</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/module/>module</a>&nbsp;

Last night my family was here, and they wanted to see the Eurovision song contest thing, so I had some time to rewrite the script into a PowerShell V2 Advanced function, that supports pipeline input.
There are some examples in the code on how to use the function</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2010-05-30-output-a-sortable-html-table/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2010-05-11-powershell-presentation-from-2010-minasi-conference/>PowerShell presentation from 2010 Minasi Conference</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2010-05-11</span></div><div class=post-content></div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2010-05-11-powershell-presentation-from-2010-minasi-conference/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2010-05-11-remoting-examples-from-my-presentation/>Remoting examples from my presentation</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2010-05-11</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/powershell/>PowerShell</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content></div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2010-05-11-remoting-examples-from-my-presentation/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2010-05-11-gotten-back-from-minasi-conference/>Gotten back from Minasi conference</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2010-05-11</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/conference/>Conference</a>&nbsp;

#<a href=/tags/powershell/>PowerShell</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content>I got back from Virgina Beach this past Saturday, after attending a very good conference, where I learned a lot of new an exciting stuff… And of course it was very good to meet up with the “gang” again.
This year I did a presentation on Powershell (wow 1 hour and 20 min goes past fast, when you are having fun)
As the presenter rookie I am, I was not able to time my presentation, so when time was up, even went 10 min over time, I still missed about a third of the presentation.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2010-05-11-gotten-back-from-minasi-conference/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2010-01-24-powershell-as-a-webservice/>Powershell as a webservice</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2010-01-24</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/powershell/>PowerShell</a>&nbsp;
#<a href=/tags/quest/>Quest</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content>Seems as if Quest has been doing some really cool things with Powershell, from what I can read, they have “rolled” it up as a webservice, meaning that you can now run your Powershell scripts over HTTPS from either you local machine, your phone, anything that supports a newer web browser.
From what I can gather from the manual, you install it on a server running IIS, you set up the site, security etc.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2010-01-24-powershell-as-a-webservice/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2009-11-30-finding-powershell-v2/>Finding Powershell V2</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2009-11-30</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/posh/>PoSH</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content>Joel Bennet made a good point about it can be difficult to find Powershell V2 on the MS site.

For some reason, people are having trouble finding links to the release version of Windows PowerShell 2.0 … I suspect it’s because while it was in CTP, a lot of us bloggers wrote about it and linked to the various CTP downloads … but there aren’t nearly as many posts announcing the release of Windows PowerShell 2.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2009-11-30-finding-powershell-v2/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2009-09-20-admgs-active-directory-management-gateway-service/>ADMGS (Active Directory Management Gateway Service)</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2009-09-20</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/ad/>AD</a>&nbsp;

So I decided to test it, I built a Server 2003 Domain, comprised of a single 2003 R2 Domain Controller, and 1 Windows 7 Enterprise workstation.
I installed Server 2003 into a VM, installed all updates inlcuding SP2, I then ran DCpromo to setup the new domain.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2009-09-20-admgs-active-directory-management-gateway-service/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2009-09-19-findind-that-hyper-v-machine/>Finding that Hyper-V machine</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2009-09-19</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/powershell/>PowerShell</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content></div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2009-09-19-findind-that-hyper-v-machine/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=/categories/tech-stuff/page/2/><span class=button__text>Older posts</span>
