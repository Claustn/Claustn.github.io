 For some reason, people are having trouble finding links to the release version of Windows PowerShell 2.0 … I suspect it’s because while it was in CTP, a lot of us bloggers wrote about it and linked to the various CTP downloads … but there aren’t nearly as many posts announcing the release of Windows PowerShell 2."><meta name=keywords content><meta name=robots content="noodp"><link rel=canonical href=/posts/2009-11-30-finding-powershell-v2/><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/style.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/green.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon-precomposed sizes=144x144 href=/img/apple-touch-icon-144-precomposed.png><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/img/favicon/green.png><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:site content><meta name=twitter:creator content><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:title" content="Finding Powershell V2 :: XenoBlog"><meta property="og:description" content="Joel Bennet made a good point about it can be difficult to find Powershell V2 on the MS site.

What? Even the Microsoft PowerShell Team Blog never actually wrote a post announcing the PowerShell 2.0 release is available for download but instead wrote about the Windows Management Framework being released.</p><p>But in any case, I’m calling on the blogging community to fix the search engines by linking Windows PowerShell and particularly “Windows PowerShell 2.0”: <a href=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968929>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968929</a> to either the Knowledge base article 968929 which has the download links for PowerShell 2.0 for Windows XP, Vista, and Server 2003 and 2008 … or to Microsoft.com/PowerShell which has the latest download links in the side-column on the right hand side. :)</p><p>I can’t fix the search engines on my own, but what was that slogan? Together we can!</p></blockquote></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/posts/2009-12-14-mstsc-util-update/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
