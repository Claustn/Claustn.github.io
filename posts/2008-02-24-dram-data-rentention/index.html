One security issue that could arise from the fact that most disk encryption software keeps the encryption key and pre computed key schedules in memory for performance reasons, meaning that if an attacker gains access to the machine he can copy these for offline attacks."><meta name=keywords content><meta name=robots content="noodp"><link rel=canonical href=/posts/2008-02-24-dram-data-rentention/><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/style.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/green.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon-precomposed sizes=144x144 href=/img/apple-touch-icon-144-precomposed.png><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/img/favicon/green.png><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:site content><meta name=twitter:creator content><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:title" content="DRAM data rentention :: XenoBlog"><meta property="og:description" content="Researchers from Princeton recently published an article about the possibility to extract information from RAM even after the PC has been turned on.
