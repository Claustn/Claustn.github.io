(So I do not have to keep track of it myself)</p><p>This is the most basic version, I came up with it on the plane home from the Forum Meet.</p><p>``</p><p>[int]$HelpNr = Get-Content -Path c:\scripts\test.ini<br>$vhelp = Get-Help * | Get-Help<br>$i=0<br>foreach ($vvhelp in $vhelp){<br>$i++<br>if ($i -eq $HelpNr) {$vvhelp}<br>}<br>$HelpNr++<br>Set-Content -Path c:\scripts\test.ini -Value $HelpNr</p><p>It has to be said though, that this is hardcoded to look for a file &ldquo;c:\scripts\test.ini " which is where it keeps track of the number of help files you have gone through.<br>If you are going to test the program, in this version you have to create the .ini file, and just put a 1 in the first line of it.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/posts/2008-05-06-browseforfolder-vbscriptpowershell/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
