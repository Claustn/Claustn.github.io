Then I remebered I wrote a post a while back about getting the phone to work as a modem, back then I figured out that I had to change the connection string to make it work..</p><p>I found my old post, typed in the connection string on the TomTom lo and behold&mldr; It connected right away&mldr; So if you want to connect you TomTom device to you mobile with a Bibob subscription, you will have to put in the following connection string : at+CGDCONT=1,&ldquo;IP&rdquo;,&ldquo;Internet.bibob.dk&rdquo;</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/posts/2009-01-22-aarrggghhh/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
