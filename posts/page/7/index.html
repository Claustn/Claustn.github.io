Today we found a few SIM cards lying around, the only thing on them was the SIM card number (19 digits). When I went to compare that to the info in the file, I realised that that was not noted in the file, so I had no way to match the SIM with a Phone number, PIN/PUK code.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2009-07-30-editing-excel-using-powershell/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2009-07-27-prevent-screensaver/>Prevent-Screensaver</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2009-07-27</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/powershell/>PowerShell</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content>A while back I created a small AutoIt script, to prevent the screensaver from kicking in, last employer had screensaver kick after 5 min, which was rather annoying when you are out doing presentations, and you have to punch in your password everytime the screensaver kicks in..
Then I read a post from Dimitry Sotnikov that he had written a small PowerShell script to do something similar, and figured out that he uses Wshell to send a keystroke, I thought that could be annoying, if you start working on the computer, and forget to stop the execution of the script, and it suddenly types a character.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2009-07-27-prevent-screensaver/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2009-07-23-installing-exchange-2007-mgmt-tools-with-powershell-ctps/>Installing Exchange 2007 Mgmt tools with PowerShell CTP&rsquo;s</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2009-07-23</span></div><div class=post-content></div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2009-07-23-installing-exchange-2007-mgmt-tools-with-powershell-ctps/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2009-07-21-get-exchange-rates/>Get Exchange rates</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2009-07-21</span></div><div class=post-content>I stumbled on a post about getting Exchange rates from a bank, from an online XML file..

Since we have more than 150 servers, there was no way I was going to create this list by hand… So I wrote a quick and dirty little Powershell function.

He asked if it was possible to write a script that would delete all the empty folders for him, I said to him that I bet it is possible, just not sure if I can do it, I have never really “scripted” Outlook before.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2009-03-30-deleting-empty-folders-in-outlook/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2009-03-11-get-mailboxinfo-powershell-script/>Get-Mailboxinfo Powershell script</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2009-03-11</span></div><div class=post-content>$script:totalSize += ([System.Int64]$mailbox.Size)
