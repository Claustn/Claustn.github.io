      One of the guys at the minasi forum had a problem with setting permissions on multiple .ini files (Had to add the Deny setting to read for a certain group), he joked that I was probably able to write a powershell script to do it.. So I took the challenge, and wrote this little script.
This script will lrecurse through the InitialFolder and all of its subfolders for Desktop.Ini files, it will then loop through each of the files, and add the DENY setting on the read permission for the local administrators group.

      I just got my new TomTom 930T GPS, I unpacked it and connected it to my phone via Bluetooth, it asked me if I wanted to connect to “internet” and of course I had to try it, it asked me which country I was in, then which phone I had, my Nokia E65 was in the list, then which telco I used… But to my luck mine was not in the list, I know my carrier Bibob uses Sonofon network, so I decided to try choosing that from the menu.

      Most companies have GPO settings that enforces a company wide screensaver policy, in my case the screensaver kicks in after 5 min.
5 Min is a very short time, when you are doing presentations or showing video content, so I decided to create a little AutoIT script to move the mouse 1 pixel after 4 min and 59 sec.
I decided to create a small tray icon, where I can choose how many minutes I want it to run for, and the icon changes in color, when the “screensaver free” time is running out.

      There was a question on the Minasi forum asking if someone had written a batch script to ping a bunch of servers.. So I thought: &quot; I have’nt, but I would like to try”.
So I started putting a few lines of batch code together, here is what I came up with.

REM Ping Servers Script
@echo off
for /f “tokens=*” %%a in (servers.txt) DO call :pingStuff %%a

      The other day I was setting up a few VmWare test environments for work, where I had to test amongst other apps Quest Recovery Manager for AD..
So I had to create some users in Active Directory, I thought I would create a PowerShell script to do that (Must keep your PS skill fresh :)
So I wrote a little code snippet to create a few OU’s.

      Have you missed me ??
I know I have been away for a while, but between becoming a dad, starting a new job, having to get deep knowledge of several different enterprise products that I have not worked with before has taken some time… But now things are looking a little less hectic, so I hope to get some good PowerShell posts written up in the near future.
In the very near future I will also write a post about the Minasi 2009 conference, that we are trying to put together for April 2009, there will be some exciting speakers lined up, but more to come one that soon.

      Our friend Darren Mar-Elia over at SDM software has just released some nice PowerShell cmdlets, to view Tombstoned objects in AD… You can even revive(or reanimate them as I think the correct AD term is) them as well.. The only requirements are PowerShell (duuh), .Net 2.0 and W2k3 running AD.
I installed it without any problems on a x86 system, but had a few minor problems running it on my 64bit Vista rig, here is what I did to get it working.
