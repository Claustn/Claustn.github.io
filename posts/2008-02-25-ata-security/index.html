This should scare off most except the mosts adamant hackers or big brother.</p><p>There is a tool called WinAAM (German) which is used to manipulate drives acoustics, it will also tell you the current security setting of the drive (You can use it to see if your BIOS sets the SECURITY FREEZE LOCK on the drive) If it doesn&rsquo;t you might consider to check for a BIOS update, and you might be lucky that the new BIOS sets it.</p><p>From what I have read I am convinced that the ATA security standard is not unbreakable, with the right experience/equipment it is still possible to bypass the ATA password, and it does not mitigate the initial problem of the possibility to extract encryption keys from RAM. But it is definitely an extra layer of security.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/posts/2008-02-27-log-in-notepad/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
