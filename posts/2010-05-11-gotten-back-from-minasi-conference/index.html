        <p>I got back from Virgina Beach this past Saturday, after attending a very good conference, where I learned a lot of new an exciting stuff&hellip; And of course it was very good to meet up with the &ldquo;gang&rdquo; again.</p>
<p>This year I did a presentation on Powershell (wow 1 hour and 20 min goes past fast, when you are having fun)<br>
As the presenter rookie I am, I was not able to time my presentation, so when time was up, even went 10 min over time, I still missed about a third of the presentation. So to make up for that, I will post all the scripts and the prensentation in its entirety, so hope you will find it usefull.</p>
