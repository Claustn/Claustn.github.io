So I did not think more of that, until I had to connect to our corporate network, using Cisco AnyConnect, and I got through both primary and secondary authentication fine, but then the connection crapped out with &ldquo;unable to establish vpn&rdquo;.. So after a few reboots and troubleshooting I ended up uninstalling the new driver, and reverting back to the old Lenovo one, I was running before.</p><p>Tonight I thought I would try again, to see if I could figure out what went wrong. So I installed the latest Intel drivers, and AnyConnect stopped working right away. So I went into Services to see what was &ldquo;new&rdquo; in there. I looked through all the Intel ones, and none of them looked &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo;, until I noticed that right below the Intel services, was &ldquo;Internet Connnection Sharing (ICS)&rdquo; and it was running. So I disabled it, and AnyConnected connected right away.</p><p>So if you have trouble connecting with AnyConnect, see if your connection has ICS enabled, or if you do not need it at all, just disable the service.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/posts/2012-09-10-troubleshooting-test-connection/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
