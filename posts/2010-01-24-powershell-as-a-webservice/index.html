One of the nice features is that you can save &ldquo;favourites&rdquo; in your web sessions,  here favourites should be seen as snippets of Powershell code, that you can just click on the run.</p><p>So imagine, you have a Powershell script that runs and checks if a particular service is running, if not it does &ldquo;Something&rdquo;. You  are sitting by the pool drinking a nice cold beer, when you get a call that there is trouble in the office. You pick up you android phone, open up a browser connects to <a href=http://www.whereIWork.com/MyPowerShell>www.whereIWork.com/MyPowerShell</a>, login.. click your Powershell favourite/snippet, and your are done..</p><p>If you figure out that did not solve the problem, you just do</p><p>Enter-PsSession -Computername &lt;Problematic Servername>, you are now running a Powershell session on the remote server, where you can look around the system, and try to fix the problem, as if you were sitting in front the server, with a Powershell console open.</p><p>Can&rsquo;t wait to I can find some time to get it tested, even thoug it still is in Beta.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/posts/2010-05-11-gotten-back-from-minasi-conference/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
