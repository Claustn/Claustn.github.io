He had started cleaning up the .pst&amp;rsquo;s manually, after having spent several hours on one .pst file he decided on another approach, and this is where I came in.
He asked if it was possible to write a script that would delete all the empty folders for him, I said to him that I bet it is possible, just not sure if I can do it, I have never really &amp;ldquo;scripted&amp;rdquo; Outlook before.</description></item></channel></rss>
