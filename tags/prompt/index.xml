      <description>There was a question on the Minasi forum asking if someone had written a batch script to ping a bunch of servers.. So I thought: &amp;quot; I have&amp;rsquo;nt, but I would like to try&amp;rdquo;.
So I started putting a few lines of batch code together, here is what I came up with.
[sourcecode lang=&amp;quot;css&amp;rdquo;]
REM Ping Servers Script
@echo off
for /f &amp;ldquo;tokens=*&amp;rdquo; %%a in (servers.txt) DO call :pingStuff %%a</description>

      <description>In PowerShell you have the option create custom profiles that you can use, in the profiles you can create different aliases, change the prompt and a lot of other things, today we will look at adding some info to prompt. First we need to open profiles.ps1 , this file can be put in the WindowsPowershell folder under System32, or in the users \My Documents\WindowsPowerShell. If you are running vista, and want to play around with your profiles.</description>
