So I decided to test it, I built a Server 2003 Domain, comprised of a single 2003 R2 Domain Controller, and 1 Windows 7 Enterprise workstation.
I installed Server 2003 into a VM, installed all updates inlcuding SP2, I then ran DCpromo to setup the new domain.</description></item><item><title>PowerShell TombStone revival</title><link>/posts/2008-06-04-powershell-tombstone-revival/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2008 15:36:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2008-06-04-powershell-tombstone-revival/</guid><description>Our friend Darren Mar-Elia over at SDM software has just released some nice PowerShell cmdlets, toÂ view Tombstoned objects in AD&amp;hellip; You can even revive(or reanimate them as I think the correct AD term is) them as well.. The only requirements are PowerShell (duuh), .Net 2.0 and W2k3 running AD.
I installed it without any problems on a x86 system, but had a few minor problems running it on my 64bit Vista rig, here is what I did to get it working.</description></item></channel></rss>
