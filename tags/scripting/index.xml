      <description>Don Jones&amp;rsquo; keynote basically said, if you do not learn PowerShell, you will not be able to function as an Windows IT administrator in 5 years time or so&amp;hellip; After what was told on the MVP summit, about Microsofts commitment to PowerShell, and how all new products will be based on it, he foresees are very dim future for admins who do not know it.
One of his suggestions was to read a PowerShell help file every day&amp;hellip; Just go through the help files one by one, you will mostÂ likely not remember all of it, but if you read enough, some point might stick ;-)</description>

      <description>In PowerShell you have the option create custom profiles that you can use, in the profiles you can create different aliases, change the prompt and a lot of other things, today we will look at adding some info to prompt. First we need to open profiles.ps1 , this file can be put in the WindowsPowershell folder under System32, or in the users \My Documents\WindowsPowerShell. If you are running vista, and want to play around with your profiles.</description>

      <description>Started playing around with PowerShell, so I thought I would post a few simple things on the blog, maybe you won&amp;rsquo;t find it interesting, but it is a good way for me to remember, so BLAH!.
First in order to get information from the eventlog you call the cmdlet called:
get-eventlog
Then you need to tell it what you want to get.
get-eventlog -logname Application
Which will get you the Application log on the local machine.</description>
