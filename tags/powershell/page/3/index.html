He had started cleaning up the .pst’s manually, after having spent several hours on one .pst file he decided on another approach, and this is where I came in.
He asked if it was possible to write a script that would delete all the empty folders for him, I said to him that I bet it is possible, just not sure if I can do it, I have never really “scripted” Outlook before.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2009-03-30-deleting-empty-folders-in-outlook/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2008-06-04-powershell-tombstone-revival/>PowerShell TombStone revival</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2008-06-04</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/ad/>AD</a>&nbsp;

First off I remembered seeing someone creating a PowerShell script, that read the input from WSH’s InputBox() by using the COM object MSScriptControl.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2008-05-06-browseforfolder-vbscriptpowershell/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2008-04-29-learning-powershell/>Learning PowerShell</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2008-04-29</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/posh/>PoSH</a>&nbsp;

One of his suggestions was to read a PowerShell help file every day… Just go through the help files one by one, you will most likely not remember all of it, but if you read enough, some point might stick ;-)</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2008-04-29-learning-powershell/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/2007-11-01-april-2008/>April 2008</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2007-11-01</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/forummeet/>Forummeet</a>&nbsp;

Of course not, PowerShell is much smarter than that…
You can use the ‘foreach’ command.

First in order to get information from the eventlog you call the cmdlet called:
get-eventlog
Then you need to tell it what you want to get.
get-eventlog -logname Application
Which will get you the Application log on the local machine.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/2007-06-18-getting-info-from-the-eventlog-with-powershell/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/tags/powershell/page/2/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
